# E-Rickshaw

A useful app for the E-Rickshaw drivers and their customers in IITG Campus. This app displays live requests of the passengers to the E-Rickshaw drivers which they can accept or reject. Once accepted, information like number, name, number-plate etc is exchanged between the driver and the passenger.
